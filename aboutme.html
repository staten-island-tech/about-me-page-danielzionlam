    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <h3>Daniel Lam</h3>
    <p>My name is Daniel Lam. I am a junior student at Staten Island Technical High School. I am a proud student of Mr.Whalen. I am very thankful for the oppertunities Mr.Whalen gives to us to learn more about coding. I worked on a few engineering passion projects in the summer with my church and I want to build a website for it and showcase our work. I like to stay active by playing sports and running track and field. Some of the sports I enjoy is volleyball and basketball, but my basketball skills pale in comparison to GOAT Whalen's greatness.</p>
